# Project Title

Stanford University Machine Learning Course in Python

The current project provides notebooks with solutions for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course (Stanford University) taught on the Coursera platform (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
The course is taught in Octave and that can be a barrier to entry for some people that are still grasping the concepts of other programming languages (Python, for example)

Important Note: The scripts do not, and are not aiming to, substitute the course. They are simply a tool that you can use when you are dealing with difficulties regarding Octave's function and programming language in general.

## Current Notebooks

Programming Assignment 1 and 2 are fully completed.
I will keep adding scripts as soon as I finish them.
